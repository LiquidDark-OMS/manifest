Build Environment
--------------------
- Official build environment as per Google and AOSP [Android source page](http://source.android.com/source/index.html)
- XDA user guides [Ubuntu 14.04 Trusty LTS](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2639611) ,

Initialize Source
--------------------
You will need to set up some directories in your build environment.

To create them run:

    mkdir -p ~/bin
    mkdir -p ~/liquid
    
    Enter the following to download the "repo" binary:

    curl http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/git-repo-downloads/repo > ~/bin/repo

    chmod a+x ~/bin/repo

You may need to reboot for these changes to take effect. 
Now enter the following to initialize the repository:

    cd ~/liquid

    repo init -u git://github.com/LiquidDark-OMS/manifest.git -b ng
